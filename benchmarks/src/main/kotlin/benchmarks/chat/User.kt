/**
 * An abstract class for server-side chat users.
 * Every user has its own channel through which users can get messages from other users [receiveAndProcessMessage],
 * users can send messages to their friends' channels as well [sendMessage].
 * User contains sent and received messages metrics.
 * To emulate real world chat servers, some work will be executed on CPU during sending and receiving messages. When user
 * connects to the server, the connection itself consumes some CPU time.
 * At the end of the benchmark execution [stopUser] should be called.
 *
 * Because of the design of the coroutines tasks scheduler and channels, it is important to call [yield] sometimes to allow other
 * coroutines to work. This is necessary due to the fact that if a coroutine constantly has some work to do, like in this
 * case if a coroutine has an endless flow of messages, it will work without interruption, and other coroutines will have to
 * wait for this coroutine to end it's execution.
 * todo: remove the call of yield when this bug is fixed
